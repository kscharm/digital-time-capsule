## Install Guide:

### Pre-requisites:
[Install Node.js 6.X or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine.
If using a production build, create a virtual machine to host the application. We suggest Amazon Web Services: [AWS EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). Note that the requirements for the virtual machine (# vCPUs, memory, storage) may change depending on the number of users.

### Dependencies:
1. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
2. [Python 2.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Steps to Install MongoDB:
1. [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community) and choose the correct distribution (Linux, MacOS, Windows) of MongoDB Community Edition. Please follow the corresponding instructions for your distribution. The following instructions are for Windows hosts. 
2. Start the MongoDB service: ```net start MongoDB```
3. Verify that MongoDB has started successfully: ```[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017```

### Download Instructions

Clone this repository into a new directory using: ```git clone https://github.com/kscharm/digital-time-capsule.git```.


### Build Instructions
This is for production builds only. If you are running this application locally, skip this step.
This app is still in the development phase. In order to create a production-ready application, you will have to change a few things:
Purchase a domain name through a service such as GoDaddy.
Replace every instance of ```http://localhost:3001``` in the source code with the domain name you want to use.
Remove the line ```proxy: http://localhost:3001``` from the ```app/package.json``` file
In the root directory, run the command: ```npm run build```. This will build the app for production in the ```build``` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Production Installation Guide
Follow [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKIIL743Gjo&t=3s) to deploy our application to an AWS EC2 instance with SSL & Nginx.


### Steps to Run:
1. Run ```npm i``` in the root directory to install all server dependencies.
2. ```cd app``` and run ```npm i``` to install all application dependencies.
3. ```cd ../auth-server``` and run  ```npm i``` to install all authorization server dependencies.
4. ```cd ..``` and run ```npm start``` to launch the application. This will run the application server, authorization server, and client simultaneously.
